# 🐱🐶 Cat vs. Dog Image Classifier using CNN (Keras)

This project demonstrates the use of a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** built with **Keras** to classify images of cats and dogs. It's a simple yet powerful deep learning model trained to distinguish between two popular pet categories using image data.

## 🚀 Tech Stack
- Python 🐍
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🧠 Model Overview
- Used the **Sequential API** from Keras to build the CNN.
- Consists of multiple convolutional, pooling, and dense layers.
- Trained on a dataset of labeled cat and dog images.
- Evaluated model performance using accuracy metrics.

## 📁 Dataset
- The model is trained on the (https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1dZvL1gi5QLwOGrfdn9XEsi4EnXx535bD).
- Images are preprocessed (resized and normalized) before training.
